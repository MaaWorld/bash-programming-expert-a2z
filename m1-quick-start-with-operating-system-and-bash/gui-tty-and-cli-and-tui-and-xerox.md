# GUI: TTY & CLI & TUI & Xerox

### User interface <a href="#user-interface" id="user-interface"></a>

We will consider OSs for PCs and notebooks only. Apart from multitasking, they provide a **graphic user interface (GUI)**. This interface is the way to interact with the system: we launch applications, configure computer devices and OS components, all via the user interface. Let’s take a look at its history and how it reached its current state.

### History of UI <a href="#history-of-ui" id="history-of-ui"></a>

Nobody worked with commercial computers interactively before 1960. Digital Equipment Corporation implemented the interactive mode for their minicomputer **PDP-1** in 1959. It was a fundamentally new approach. Before that, IBM computers dominated the market in the 1950s. They worked in batch processing mode only. This mode automated program loading and provided high performance for tasks involving calculation.

#### The SAGE project <a href="#the-sage-project" id="the-sage-project"></a>

The idea of interactive work with computers appeared first in the SAGE (Semi-automatic Ground Environment) military project by the US Air Force. The goal of the project was to develop an automated air defense system to detect Soviet bombers.

When working on the SAGE project, engineers faced an interesting problem. The user of the system needed to analyze data from radars in real-time and react as quickly as possible. However, existing methods of interaction with computers didn’t fit this task. They did not let the computer show information to the user in real-time and receive the user’s input at any moment.

Engineers then came to the idea of interactive mode. They implemented it in the first interactive computer **AN/FSQ-7** in 1955. The figure below shows this computer.

The computer used a monitor with a cathode-ray tube to display information from radar. The light pen allowed the user to command the system.

#### Benefits of interactive mode <a href="#benefits-of-interactive-mode" id="benefits-of-interactive-mode"></a>

The software development workflow differs when we use an interactive mode. We prepare our program and load it to the computer. Then, it launches the program and shows us results. Immediately, we can analyze a possible error, fix it, and relaunch the program. This workflow significantly accelerates the processes of software development and debugging tasks. Now, we spend a few hours on a task that would require days with batch processing.

#### Challenges of the interactive mode <a href="#challenges-of-the-interactive-mode" id="challenges-of-the-interactive-mode"></a>

Interactive mode brought new challenges for computer engineers. This mode required a system that reacted to user actions immediately. Also, providing a short reaction time required a new load-balancing mechanism. The concept of multitasking became a solution to this problem.

#### Alternatives to the interactive mode <a href="#alternatives-to-the-interactive-mode" id="alternatives-to-the-interactive-mode"></a>

There are alternatives to multitasking that still provide an interactive mode. For example, there are interactive single-tasking OSs like MS-DOS. MS-DOS was the system for cheap PCs of the 1980s.

However, it was inadvisable to apply single-tasking in the 1960s when computers were too expensive. These computers executed many programs in parallel in a concept called **time-sharing**. It allowed several users to share expensive hardware resources. The single-tasking approach does not fit such a use case because it is not compatible with time-sharing.

### Single-tasking OSs <a href="#single-tasking-oss" id="single-tasking-oss"></a>

When the first relatively cheap personal computers appeared in the 1980s, they used single-tasking OSs. Such systems required fewer hardware resources than their analogs with multitasking. Despite their simplicity, single-tasking OSs supported interactive mode for the currently running program. This mode became especially attractive for PC users.

When interactive mode became more and more popular, computer engineers faced a new challenge. The existing devices to interact with computers turned out to be inconvenient. Magnetic tapes and printers were widespread through the 1950s and early 1960s. They did not fit interactive mode absolutely.
